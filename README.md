# Kush's Gym - Personal Gym Website

Welcome to **Kush's Gym**, a simple, responsive website created for a gym or fitness-related business. This project is designed using basic **HTML5** and **CSS3** to create a visually engaging and easy-to-navigate webpage. The page provides sections like navigation links, contact information, and other gym-related content.

## Features

### 1. **Header Section**
   - **Left Section**: Displays a custom message ("I am left"), which can be updated or replaced with any content.
   - **Middle Section**: Contains a navigation bar with links such as:
     - **Home**: Link to the homepage of the gym website.
     - **Fitness**: Link to a fitness-related section or page.
     - **About Us**: Link to a page that contains details about the gym and its services.
     - **Contact Us**: Link to a contact form or the gym's contact details.
   - **Right Section**: Displays another custom message ("I am right"), which can be replaced with gym-specific content like promotions, announcements, or quotes.

### 2. **Responsive Layout**
   - The webpage uses **CSS Flexbox** and **inline-block** to create a flexible and responsive layout, ensuring the design adapts seamlessly across devices, including mobile phones and desktops.
   - The navigation bar and layout automatically adjust to the screen size for improved user experience.

### 3. **Styling**
   - **Background Image**: The page uses a dynamic background image (`img/b1.jpg`). You can replace this with your own image to reflect the gymâ€™s aesthetic.
   - **Navigation Links**: The navigation bar has simple white text with padding and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
   - **Custom Styling**: The page includes borders around different sections (left, right, middle) for visual structure.
